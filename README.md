# Stock_analysis_1
This is a project assignment from DSC 80 at UCSD instructed by Professor Justin Eldridge during Fall 2022. In collaboration with Zhengyun Nie(znie@ucsd.edu), as a group, we analyzed the stock trades of the US House of Representatives. In this report, we cleaned the data, explored the data through univariate and bivariate anlysis as well as aggregation, assessed the missingness of one of the columns, and conducted a hypothesis test on whether the trades are evenly distributed on each weekday.
